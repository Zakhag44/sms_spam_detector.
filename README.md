# Overview.

This project showcases the creation of an SMS spam classification model using TF-IDF vectorization and a Linear Support Vector Classification (LinearSVC) algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). The process involves importing necessary libraries, preparing the dataset, and using a pipeline to integrate TF-IDF vectorization with LinearSVC for efficient text processing and classification.

To make the model accessible, the notebook uses Gradio to build an interactive web application. This application allows users to input SMS messages and receive real-time classification results, indicating whether the message is spam or not. The combination of machine learning and Gradio creates a user-friendly interface, demonstrating how to deploy a practical and interactive spam classification tool.

# Correct File Path
Make sure to use the gradio_sms_text_clasification(2) file for final review.

Items of Note: because I did this in colab and not in VS code you may need to update the path for the CSV file path in the gradio_sms_text_clasification(2) file.
